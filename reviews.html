             The service is great, everyone is very nice.
             You can tell how much the instructors care and they make it fun for the kids. They are learning a lot. The progress has been amazing.

 love everything – I love the personal attention to the kids, I love the booking process, it’s been fantastic.
  My kids have advanced so far in their swimming, I can’t even believe how far they have come.

This is our second year with FA swimming academy.
 We’ve really enjoyed it so far! Our instructor is GREAT and made my daughter feel comfortable in the water without pressuring her to do things she isn’t ready for. She’s having fun and learning.
